# PilotNow

**Smart Workforce Management via WhatsApp**

Built by [NexStack Pte Ltd](https://nexstack.sg)

---

PilotNow enables security manpower companies to manage their workforce end-to-end using WhatsApp as the primary interface, powered by automation and AI.

## The Problem

Security manpower companies rely on WhatsApp, phone calls, and paper-based processes to manage jobs, officers, attendance, and billing. These workflows are manual, time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale.

- Manual job posting takes 10–15 minutes per job
- Difficult to track job acceptance in busy WhatsApp chats
- Frequent phone calls to chase officers for check-ins and photos
- Missing or unreliable attendance proof (no GPS, timestamps)
- Paper-based signatures that are delayed or lost
- Slow DO report preparation leading to delayed billing and cash-flow gaps

## MVP Scope

**Users:** Admin (Operations Manager) + Security Officers via WhatsApp

| Feature | Description |
