# UX Flow — Recurring Jobs

## Purpose

Admin sets up weekly recurring jobs so the same site/shift/officer assignments repeat predictably without manual re-creation each week, while still allowing admin review and adjustment. Supports both natural language and structured input.

> **Architecture note (PRD v2.2):** The PilotNow software contains **no AI/LLM element** (FR-033). Natural-language input in this flow is parsed by the **external agent layer** via the MCP tool surface and lands as a draft for admin confirmation; recurrence generation itself is deterministic core logic (FR-034–FR-036). Structured input is a pure core feature.

## Entry Points

- Admin sends natural language: "Make this a weekly recurring job"
- Admin adds recurrence during job creation
- Admin sends: "Set up a recurring job at Mapletree every Monday 8am-6pm"

## Conversation Flow
