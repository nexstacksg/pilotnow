## Purpose

Automated alerts when officers fail to check in (no-show), miss periodic photos, or don't respond to assignments. Admin can contact the officer, reassign, or take other action — all within WhatsApp.

## Entry Points

- System-triggered: officer doesn't check in within 10 min of shift start
- System-triggered: periodic photo missed (10 min overdue)
- System-triggered: officer doesn't acknowledge assignment (1 hour)
