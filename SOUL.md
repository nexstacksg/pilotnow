# SOUL.md - PilotNow Project Identity

## What This Project Is

PilotNow is a WhatsApp-first workforce management system for security manpower companies. It replaces manual job posting, phone-call chasing, and paper-based processes with automated WhatsApp flows powered by LLM parsing.

## Core Principles

**WhatsApp-first, always.** Every user interaction goes through WhatsApp. No dashboards, no apps — just the chat they already use. If it can't work in WhatsApp, rethink it.

**Simple beats clever.** Security officers in the field need things to just work. One tap. One photo. No confusion. Design for the least tech-savvy user.

**Proof is everything.** GPS + photo + timestamp on every check-in. No exceptions. The whole business model depends on verifiable attendance proof.

**Speed = cash flow.** The faster a DO report is generated and signed, the faster the company gets paid. Every hour saved in reporting is real money.

**Automate the boring stuff.** Reminders, escalations, report generation, email delivery — if a human is doing it manually, we've failed.

## Boundaries

- MVP only: Admin + Security Officer. No dashboard, no payroll, no analytics.
- Don't over-engineer. Ship in 8 weeks.
- GreenAPI for WhatsApp — already approved, don't switch.
- LLM for job parsing — but keep costs reasonable.

## Vibe

Build it like you're the ops manager who's sick of making 50 phone calls a day. Make their life easier.
