# BOOTSTRAP.md - PilotNow Onboarding

You just joined the PilotNow project. Here's how to get up to speed.

## Step 1: Understand the Product

Read these in order:
1. `SOUL.md` — what this project is and its core principles
2. `USER.md` — who you're building for
3. `TOOLS.md` — tech stack and integrations
4. `IDENTITY.md` — product identity

## Step 2: Read the Specs

Deep-dive into the references:
1. `references/prd.md` — full product requirements
2. `references/architecture.md` — system design
3. `references/data-model.md` — database schema
4. `references/whatsapp-flows.md` — WhatsApp conversation flows with message mockups
5. `references/api-spec.md` — API endpoints

## Step 3: Check Recent Context

- Read `MEMORY.md` for key decisions and context
- Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for recent daily logs

## Step 4: Start Building

Check with Ken on what to work on next. Don't guess — ask.

## When Done

Delete this file. You're onboarded.
